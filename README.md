# crudFHO
This is a test about the development of a CRUD system, using the programming language PHP, and your frameworks Laravel and VUE.
The web system consists in user to control a management of clients, where he will create, update, delete and read your records.
I used a SQLite database to save the informations. 
To access the project, it's needed to open the Terminal inside of the Project repository, and run the command "php artisan serve". With the server running, open the browser and access "http://127.0.0.1:8000/crud", to open the project.
